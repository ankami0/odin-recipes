    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lane cake, also known as prize cake or Alabama Lane cake, is a four-layer white cake with a bourbon-spiked raisin filling that originated in the American South. It's the official state cake of Alabama.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>8 egg whites</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brandy flavoring</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1 cup raisins</li>
        <li>½ cup candied cherries, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour four 8 inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Cream 1 cup of the butter or margarine, 2 cups of the white sugar, and vanilla together until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts alternately with the milk in two parts, beginning and ending with flour.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites until stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter evenly into the four prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool. Once cool spread Lane Cake Filling between layers and frost with Seven Minute or Butter Frosting.</li>
        <li>To Make Lane Cake Filling: Put 1/2 cup of the butter or margarine and 1-1/4 cups of the white sugar into the top of a double boiler away from the heat. Beat together. Add egg yolks and beat well. Stir in water and brandy flavoring.</li>
        <li>Place over boiling water. Cook and stir until thickened. Add pecans, raisins, cherries and coconut. Stir filling until all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Allow filling to cool before spreading between cooled cake layers.</li>
